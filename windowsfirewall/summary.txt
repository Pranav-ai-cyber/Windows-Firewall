In this task, Windows Defender Firewall was used to create and test a custom inbound rule that blocks traffic on Telnet port 23. The process involved listing current firewall rules, selecting the port-based rule option, specifying TCP port 23, and choosing the “block the connection” action. The new rule was named and applied, then verified using the command prompt—confirming that Telnet connections were successfully blocked.

This experiment demonstrates how Windows firewall rules can precisely filter network traffic by protocol and port, strengthening endpoint security while allowing granular management. Proper documentation and thoughtful rule design help maintain clarity and effectiveness in production environments. By understanding and applying these principles, device exposure to unwanted or risky network traffic is significantly reduced.
